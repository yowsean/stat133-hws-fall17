## Comments and Reflections

* The hardest part was figuring out the format for latex.
* Most of the markdown was generally easy.
* This was the first time I used markdown and it seems very straightforward.
* I did not need help for the assignment
* I spent around 20-30 minutes
* The most time consuming part was writing out the recipe.
